This is the CS 301 101 project proposal for group 8, we will be competing in the Kaggle competition for rating the severity of toxicity of wikipedia comments linked here https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-toxic-severity-rating. The goal of this project is to have a program that takes in comments and outputs an accurate toxicity score based on the professional raters that the kaggle competition used. In this project we will be utilizing common NLP techniques to find common topics that relate to toxicity as well as exploring other options for rating how a comment is toxic. We will start by using a sentiment analyser to determine how positive or negative a comment is https://towardsdatascience.com/lovecraft-with-natural-language-processing-part-1-rule-based-sentiment-analysis-5727e774e524. We will also explore some other nlp techniques such as aspect mining and we might look at topic modeling however that may not have much merit for toxicity ratings. Apart from using NLP to extract more features we will have to make a predictive algorithm to utilize the information we gathered. This part of the project is not our main focus so we will most likely utilize simple techniques like decision trees or random forest classifier. The way we will track how well our program does is by using a loss function such as mean squared error with our programs output and the professional raters output as the two samples.
